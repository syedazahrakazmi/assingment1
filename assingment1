I'm Zahra kazmi. Here is some information about me:
 My favourite quotation is "Never give up".
 I do not like sweet dishes.
 I would recommend you to go any where in the world where you can afford to go and explore.
 I learned a new word in German language `fenster tag` which means the work day in between the public holiday and the weekend
Sometimes its nice to do just nothing and enjoy the free time
