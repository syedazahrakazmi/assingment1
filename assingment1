I'm Zahra kazmi. Here is some information about me:
1. My favourite quotation is "Never give up".
2. I do not like sweet dishes.
3. I would recommend you to go any where in the world where you can afford to go and explore.
4. I learned a new word in German language `fenster tag` which means the work day in between the public holiday and the weekend
